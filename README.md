## Summary of Assignment
<p>This repository contains my programming and scripting problem sheet 2021. In this eight weeks, was developed skills in, github, Matplolib, Seaborn, NumPy and Pandas.</p>


## 1-BMI.py week 02
<p>1- Write a program that calculates somebody’s Body Mass Index (BMI) The inputs are the person's height in centimetres and weight in kilograms. The output is their weight divided by their height in metres squared.</p>

### Code

<p><b>*set variables weight and height and collect user input</b> <br> weight = float(input("Enter your weight in kilograms: "))<br>height = float(input("Enter your height in centimeters: "))</p>

<p><b>*perform BMI calculation conversion of height cm to meters</b> <br> height_meters = height / 100<br> bmi = weight / (height_meters  ** 2)</p>

<p><b>*print formatting method may not work in older versions python</b><br> print('BMI is: {}.'.format(round(bmi, 2)))</p>
